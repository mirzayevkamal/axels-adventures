I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
NameError: name 'isabella' is not defined. Did you mean: 'isabelle'?

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "game/intro.rpy", line 683, in script
    isabella "Can I ask you something? Umm... ohh... I just wanted to say..."
Exception: Sayer 'isabella' is not defined.
