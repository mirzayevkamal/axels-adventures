    # narrator "Once upon a time, in the scorching heat of the Wild West, there was an army of soldiers tirelessly devoted to their country, bound by deep loyalty and serving its security."

    # narrator "The months they spent under harsh conditions, uncertain and brutal weather, hunger, and the longing for their families deeply shook them."

    # scene story_2 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "But most importantly, what truly disturbed the soldiers was living under the command of a dominant, rough-natured commander. Yes, you heard that right—a dominant and crude individual."

    # scene story_3 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "The kind of man who thought himself the alpha male in a wolf pack—fierce, self-centered, overly confident, strong, masculine."

    # narrator "And, despite all these traits, incredibly attractive in his ruggedness."

    # scene story_4
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Despite all these qualities, perhaps due to the tension from his high testosterone, he did many things to relieve it. While exhausting his soldiers with his roughness, he also flirted with the women in the army—secretaries and nurses—who were enamored by this muscular, charismatic, and charming playboy."

    # narrator "They admired him and would do anything to catch his eye. The women's weakness for him only boosted his confidence further."

    # scene story_5 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Sometimes, the occasional thirst and hunger in the army made things even harder for the soldiers. Already frayed by tough conditions, they could barely tolerate the commander's crude behavior."

    # narrator "Though the soldiers never failed in showing respect due to his rank, they understood that only his word mattered here. All they could do was follow orders, accept him as he was, and continue their days in the army."

    # scene story_6
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Aside from the dominant nature his profession gave him, the confidence from never being rejected by a woman made him even prouder."

    # narrator "Perhaps he was right, as women who secretly lusted after him, even behind their lovers' backs, wrote letters and went crazy with the desire to sleep with him."

    # scene story_24 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Once, there was a nurse who had a soldier boyfriend but ended her relationship because she was in love with the commander. When the soldier asked why she wanted to break up, she replied, 'I can't see a future in our relationship.'"

    # narrator "Five days after this conversation, the soldier happened to stop by the commander's office and heard his ex-girlfriend's voice from inside. Without knocking, he entered."

    # scene story_25 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "When the soldier walked in, he caught his ex-girlfriend having sex with Commander Axel."

    # narrator "He finally understood why she wanted to end their relationship—she, like the other women, had fallen for Axel."

    # scene story_7 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "The soldiers now knew the rumors about women occasionally visiting Axel's office to sleep with him were true."

    # narrator "Axel took pleasure in all of this and fed his ego. The way women idolized him was, for a man, the true meaning of power."

    # scene story_8 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "His flirtatious and dominant nature must have been at its peak, as he wasn't satisfied with what he was doing. Every day, he pursued more and different fantasies, living new experiences."

    # narrator "It was clear that these experiences became increasingly thrilling for those he slept with. Who knows… perhaps what made Axel so attractive to them was his roughness."

    # scene story_26 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Seeing the girl as his prey for the day, Axel was no different from a wild lion. Grabbing her possessively by the throat from behind, he didn't hesitate to thrust his cock deep inside her."

    # narrator "The nurse's expression made it abundantly clear how satisfied she was, finally having the man she'd dreamed of and lusted after."

    # scene story_27 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "While all this was happening, the nurse, caught by her ex-boyfriend soldier, continued having sex with Axel without even being bothered by his presence."

    # narrator "She seemed completely content, screaming with pleasure as if no one else was in the room, her eyes rolling back in ecstasy."

    # scene story_28 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Realizing the army rumors were true, the soldier, despite being shocked by witnessing such a scene for the first time, quietly left the room."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Though hard to believe, he had somehow accepted it and moved on from his ex-girlfriend. After all, they were already broken up."

    # scene story_9 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "In his office, Axel spent time with young nurses and secretaries, fucking them without mercy. The girls loved this side of him."

    # narrator "Strangely, the women who initially seemed to resist him were only pretending, secretly burning with desire for him to take them. Some eagerly awaited the night, rushing to his office as soon as it got dark."

    # narrator "Come here. Don't be shy... I know exactly what you came for."

    # scene story_11 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Always ready to be seduced, Axel never sent his sweet visitors away empty-handed."

    # narrator "The girls who willingly came to his room were thrilled by Axel's intentions. It even became an addiction for some."

    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "They couldn't believe how they'd gotten to this point. Was it a devil's temptation or the ability to be both dark and irresistibly attractive?"
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Being dominated and fucked by a sexy, wild alpha male must have been their weakness, as Axel knew this and treated each woman like she was his own while fucking them."

    # scene story_13 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "The girls, accustomed to pleasing their muscular man's big cock, waited for nightfall to satisfy him, unaware of each other. Some, hearing moans from outside his office, would turn back."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "When Axel sensed multiple girls at his door, he'd invite them in, sometimes fucking several at once. To them, Axel was the real man."

    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "As days passed, Axel's lust only grew. He even had sex with five or six women at once in his office."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "The girls would plan together and surprise him at night. The moans from his office could be heard by other soldiers, who had grown accustomed to his playboy ways and knew almost everything."

    # scene story_15 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "With his massive cock, muscular body, and harsh demeanor, he fucked like a wild animal, captivating his women."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "At night, he'd visit empty hospital rooms under the guise of inspection, spending time with nurses—many of whom had already been to his office and orgasmed with his big cock. To them, Axel was happiness."

    # scene story_16 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "On every visit, Axel seduced different girls, making them his own, and took pleasure in their screams as they were fucked. Trying to fit his large, veiny cock into their tight pussies turned him on even more."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "The girls clearly loved his massive, thick cock, their rolled-back eyes and the pleasure dripping from their pussies to his balls proving it."
    # pause 1.0

    # scene story_17 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Most of the women in the army had seen each other during group sex and had all been fucked by Axel in turn. Few in the massive army remained unaware of his sex games. Others had heard tales of how great a fucker he was."

    # narrator "Nothing was a secret anymore. Some nights, three or four girls, sometimes five or six, would go to his office without hesitation. Axel's lust had become like a plague, spreading to the girls. Their only desire was to be fucked by his massive, insatiable cock."

    # scene story_18 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "As days went by, tensions in the army rose due to discord, harsh weather, and tough conditions. Some suffered from hunger and thirst, others from the army's challenges."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Rising rebellions were partly due to soldiers and their families writing letters to the government, complaining about Axel's roughness."

    # scene story_22 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Axel was cunning and smart, and it wasn't hard for him to anticipate what might happen. A secret nighttime operation was organized by government officials to end his command."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "As everyone slept, the place echoed with the footsteps of black-masked government soldiers. The army had stopped protecting the state and had become like Axel's empire for his desires. The soldiers, already aware of the situation, weren't surprised."

    # scene story_19 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "But there was something no one knew: some women in the army, including nurses who were in love with Axel and had slept with him, helped him escape. It was too late… Yes, you heard right."

    # scene story_20 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Whether they helped him out of fear or gratitude wasn't clear, but Axel was the winner. For him, sex was a unique way to seduce women and make them fall for him."

    # narrator "They were so devoted to him that they'd risk their jobs and reputations to help him."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Helping a criminal makes you one, but this was different—because Axel was different. None of them had ever been with a man like him."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Despite his roughness, he was still Axel. They willingly helped the hero of their adrenaline-filled, dangerous sex adventures with heartfelt gratitude. The masked soldiers, hoping to catch Axel off guard in his office, were disappointed."

    # scene story_23 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "The room was empty. The fantasy sex toys, pleasure devices, sperm stains scattered around, and bottles of massage oil in the drawers were proof of everything."
    # pause 1.0

    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "As time passed, stories about this mysterious and dangerous man began to spread everywhere. The whole country was talking about him, uneasy."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Though the women he slept with didn't give interviews about their time with him, they secretly missed him and were sad, knowing they'd never find a man like him again. What started as love had turned into pleasure for them. It was clear the secretaries and nurses were heartbroken over his departure."

    # scene story_30 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Realizing his pictures were everywhere and his name was on everyone's lips, Axel understood that hiding in the city could only help so much."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "No matter how cautious or cunning he was, with his face plastered on every wall, he knew he could no longer live there and had to move to a place where no one would find him."

    # scene story_31 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "The 'Untrodden Forest' was miles away from the city, covered in dense trees, rarely visited by people—sometimes not for years."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "It had beautiful nature, stunning views, and many dangerous animals."

    # scene story_32 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "That's why Axel's choice of this place was significant. He knew no one would find him here."

    # narrator "He was aware he had to leave modern life behind."

    # scene story_33 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "His advanced military training made him strong enough to survive in the wild. His hunting skills, alertness, cunning, and masculine instincts made him a true alpha animal."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "His ability to establish a life in such a dangerous forest was proof of his strength."

    # scene story_34 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "You could say he was now the king of this forest. He knew it like the back of his hand, setting various traps to hunt easily."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Hardly anyone came to this forest anyway, which is why it was called the 'Wilderness.'"

    # scene story_35 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Despite everything that had happened recently, Axel never once felt fear or regret. Day by day, he adapted to his new life."

    # narrator "But a wounded animal is always more dangerous. And even if he seemed calm… inside, the collapse of the army's structure had only fueled his rage."

    # narrator "It made Axel even more dominant, even more brutal."

    # scene story_36 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "For a commander, the most important thing was having a stronghold. A place to feel safe, to shield himself from any threat. Trusting his instinct, Axel had claimed the safest ground in the entire forest on day one:"

    # narrator "Surrounded by thick trees and massive rocks, cloaked in darkness, close to every part of the forest, and most importantly—a cave so hidden that no one would find it."

    # narrator "And even if someone did, no one would dare step inside."

    # scene story_37 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "The fire inside the pitch-black cave cast flickering shadows across the damp, sunless stone. His eyes stared into the dark while his hunger twisted inside him. But this wasn't hunger for food."

    # narrator "This was pure, raw, sexual need. Days without a woman… his cock ached with a throbbing lust he couldn't shake."

    # narrator "The only thing he missed from the army were the women who worshipped him nightly—their moans, their mouths, their drenched pussies… and all the filthy fantasies they played out for him. He finally understood what desperation really meant."

    # scene story_38 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "But he had no idea that fate was about to hand him a gift. The way a thirsty soul finds water in a desert—Axel was about to experience something just as powerful."

    # narrator "A situation that was impossible to dream of… Yet was about to happen anyway."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "It would satisfy his feral lust. But it would also spark a chain of new, dangerous events."

    # scene story_39 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Wow… I can't wait to start cataloguing the new plant species here. This forest is untouched by humans, and probably hasn't been explored in decades."

    # narrator "If I, a PhD biology student, were to discover a new species—it'd be a university sensation."
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Haha, okay, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself—but still… Even if I can't become a professor right away, this will help me become a better biologist after graduation."

    # narrator "Honestly, isabelle, when I said we should go on a trip, I chose this place specifically so I could combine it with research. I have a feeling this forest is going to bring me luck. I know it will."

    # narrator "What do you think? Aren't these plants amazing?"

    # scene story_41 at pan_zoom with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Ah, Cody… If only you gave me as much attention as you do these damn plants. When I said yes to this trip, I saw it as our last chance to reignite something—something hot, something real. But I think I was wrong."

    # narrator "And now it's too late… because we're already here. Plus, I invited my friends to join. They didn't want to disappoint me, so they came along."

    # narrator "I still can't believe I traveled all this way just to look at a few weeds. Anyway, I need to start rehearsing for my dance competition. At least the view out here is good enough to help me focus."

    # scene story_42 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "And thank God I invited my friends at the last minute… Otherwise I'd have been stuck alone for days with this pathetic Cody. You asked me for one more chance, Cody."

    # narrator "And even after everything, I gave it to you. You know I'm a strong, ambitious woman who takes what she wants—and you know I carry a high-voltage feminine energy that not every man can handle. I told you from day one: not just any guy can keep up with me."

    # narrator "Back when I first met you—after one of my shows—you approached me with that 'bad boy' charm. Yeah, it worked… at first."

    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "But now, your cowardice, your limp behavior, your weak performance in bed—it's all become unbearable. I've been telling you for two weeks I want to break up. And I think I've said it clearly enough by now. This isn't working."

    # narrator "We're not working. Why are you still clinging to this? Do you even remember the last time we had sex? It's been over a month."

    # narrator "And it lasted five damn minutes. I gave you this trip as one final shot. But of course, you only brought me here for your precious plants."

    # scene story_44 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Mm… well, isabelle, I really like you. Just being near you, holding your hand—it calms me. I imagined us walking hand in hand through the grass on the way here… maybe even finding a four-leaf clover."

    # narrator "And maybe you could help me find some useful herbs too? Like Aesculus hippocastanum or Hypericum perforatum? I ran out of face masks… and I want to make a natural one from scratch."

    # narrator "Wouldn't that be great? Oh, I wonder if Valerie would want some too. I'll make extras."

    # narrator "This idiot must be joking. I'm so turned on again, it's insane. God, I wish we'd at least had sex tonight. That would've been better than nothing. Cody, look… we haven't had any time alone in weeks."

    # narrator "How about tonight, in the tent… we do something nice together? Maybe then I'll rethink this breakup thing. At least I'd get off without my vibrator for once, which would help me relax for tomorrow's dance rehearsal."

    # narrator "Let's have one last wild night, Cody. What do you say? Should we burn off a little tension tonight?"

    # scene story_46 with dissolve
    # pause 1.0

    # narrator "Ugh, this idea to split up and explore separately was so dumb. We should've stayed together. Should we go back? Whatever, we came all this way. Might as well enjoy the view, Tobby."

    # narrator "I knew isabelle invited us because she was fed up with Cody, but we came for her. And honestly, the scenery is incredible. Way better than the view of empty glasses behind the bar. This break is a good excuse to get away from work for a few days."

    # narrator "Now if only we'd come with some guy who had a huge dick… He'd be fucking me under every damn tree in this place. Why so quiet, Tobby? Where are you looking?"

    # narrator "Not that I'd mind seeing half-naked guys dance instead. You have no idea how hard it is being a gay man in that place, haha. Let's walk a bit more, then we'll head back to isabelle. The air here is weird, right?"

    # narrator "Feels like it gives you energy. Honestly, it's making me so horny again. If I had a muscular guy with a fat cock here, I'd drag him into the tent and ride him until sunrise… mmphh."

    # narrator "Hahaha, I literally just thought the same thing. But come on, who else could even be in this untouched forest besides us? We've got a few days before we go back to the city."

    # narrator "Hold it together. You'll find another guy with a big cock soon enough and drag him into your backroom at the bar. I'm saying this to you, Tobby, but honestly… I don't know how I'm going to survive these next few days."

    # narrator "Ahhh, isabelle—we're putting up with all of this just to keep you company. Let's go back to them before Cody makes her lose her shit, haha. Also… I'm starting to get hungry."

    isabelle "Otherwise I'd be stuck following Cody's lame schedule. At least tonight, I'll get some satisfaction in bed. And if I spend the next few days dancing and hanging with my friends, then go back to the city and dump Cody,"
