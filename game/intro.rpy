The months under harsh conditions, unpredictable and difficult weather, and at times hunger, not to mention the longing they felt from being separated from their families, shook them to their core." at top_text with dissolve

    show text "This man was a vicious person who considered himself the alpha male of a wolf pack. He was tough, self-centered, and proved his dominance to everyone by demeaning even other men.

    show text "Aside from all these traits, perhaps it was the tension from his high testosterone, which he would do many things to alleviate. In addition to giving his soldiers a hard time, he had subjugated the women in the army just to please himself. The secretaries and nurses in the army would not tell anyone anything because if the word got out, he would be in trouble, and he wouldn't stand for it." at center_text with dissolve

    show text "Occasional thirst and hunger made everything even harder for the soldiers. The violent and sometimes humiliating punishments he inflicted on the soldiers were so brutal that no one dared to defy him. All the soldiers in the army had now understood that his word was law here and that resistance was pointless. Sadly, all they could do was accept the situation and continue their days in the army." at bottom_text with dissolve
